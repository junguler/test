here is a summery of what i've done to this point:

[test 1](https://junguler.github.io/test/test1/test1.html) - it uses a [js code](https://www.draketo.de/software/m3u-player.js) i've [found online](https://www.draketo.de/software/m3u-player.html) to embed multi-track .m3u streams to a audio or video tag, effectively making a playlist

[test 2](https://junguler.github.io/test/test2/test2.html) - use the same code as test 1 but applied to videos

[test 3](https://junguler.github.io/test/test3/test3.html) - using the [able player](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer) to embed a few online radio streams as a proof of concept

[test 4](https://junguler.github.io/test/test4/test4.html) - using the able player again but using music from this repo

[test 5](https://junguler.github.io/test/test5/test5.html) - using a audio/video player plugin for [mediaelement](https://www.mediaelementjs.com/) to embed a few radio streams to a audio player, i've used code from [this fork](https://github.com/duozersk/mep-feature-playlist) and [this fork](https://github.com/xitobg/mediaelement-playlist-plugin/tree/master/lib/mediaelement)

[test 6](https://junguler.github.io/test/test6/test6.html) - a simple example of using the default player and applying playlists as list of clickable links, code was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/severak/html5-playlist)

[test 7](https://junguler.github.io/test/test7/test7.html) - a simple and elegent way to embed songs to a playlist via json formatting, code was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/worldzhao/url-music-player)

[test 8](https://junguler.github.io/test/test8/test8.html) - another attempt to mess around with able player, this time i've added a scroll in the playlist section when it has many entries and tried to style the button a little bit to be more dark mode friendly

if the music from online radio stations are not playing it's probably because you are using a chromium based web browser (chrome, vivaldi, opera, edge etc ...), [check here](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/29505473?hl=en&msgid=29673696) for a workaround

more example pages are going to be added as i discover more html5 players that i like to test

an eventual cleaning up and publishing of these pages on a different repo is in the works but things are going to be messy for the time being as i'm actively testing things
