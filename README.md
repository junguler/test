here is a summery of what i've done to this point:

[test 1](https://junguler.github.io/test/1.html) - it uses a [js code](https://www.draketo.de/software/m3u-player.js) i've [found online](https://www.draketo.de/software/m3u-player.html) to embed multi-track streams to a audio or video tag, effectively making a playlist

[test 2](https://junguler.github.io/test/2.html) - use the same code as test 1 but applied to videos

[test 3](https://junguler.github.io/test/demos/test.html) - using the [able player](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer) to embed a few online radio streams as a proof of concept

[test 4](https://junguler.github.io/test/demos/test2.html) - using the able player again but using music from this repo

[test 5](https://junguler.github.io/test/test5/test5.html) - using a audio/video player plugin for [mediaelement](https://www.mediaelementjs.com/) to embed a few radio streams to a audio player, i've used code from [this fork](https://github.com/duozersk/mep-feature-playlist) and [this fork](https://github.com/xitobg/mediaelement-playlist-plugin/tree/master/lib/mediaelement)

more example pages are going to be added as i discover more html5 players that i like to test
