the goal for this repo is test different audio and video players and find the abseloute best solution for my m3u repo to embed the radio stream online using github pages

the repo is currently running a js code that embeds m3u streams with the default audio player of each web browser, it's works but doesn't look native

i've uploaded an example of how these look inside this page, click on [test 1](https://junguler.github.io/test/1.html) and [test 2](https://junguler.github.io/test/2.html) for audio and video player showcase

i've also started working on using other html5 players and after some trial and error i was able to get able player's audio version working, here an example with [radio streams](https://junguler.github.io/test/demos/test.html) and another one with [local files](https://junguler.github.io/test/demos/test2.html) 

next step is the video player and implementing other players in the future

everything inside this repo is from royalty free videos and music from youtube, no copyright was harmed in the process, this is just a test page
