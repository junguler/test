a place to test things i'm trying out

so far i've made the playlist buttons bigger, changed mouse cursor when it's hovered over them, change them to actual buttons and made the opacity of titles 100%, changed the position of the playlist keys to left and right of the audio player

still need to make the playlist keys look more native to firefox's media player and possibly add glyphs to them

long term goal is to make the playlist button look completely native to firefox's media player and apply my css stylings inside the javascript file
