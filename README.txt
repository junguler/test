a place to test things i'm trying out

currently working on: attempting to get a unfied look for audio and video tags and testing different ways to showcase videos and audios within a github page

next step is to find some royalty free videos in different dimensions and test them in the website, especially interested in vertical, ultra wide and 4:3 videos
