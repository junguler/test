a place to test things i'm trying out

so far i've made the playlist buttons bigger, changed mouse cursor when it's hovered over them, change them to actual buttons and made the opacity of titles 100%

still need to change the position of the playlist keys to left and right of the audio player and make them look more native to firefox's media player and possibly add glyphs to them, if you know how these things are done please send me an issue or pull request as i'm not very familiar with these stuff

long term goal is to make the m3u java script player my own and apply it to my m3u repo's github pages for listening to music online

everything in this repo is from royalty videos of youtube, no copyright was harmed, this is just a test page
